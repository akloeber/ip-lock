# IpLock

An inter-process lock for synchronization of multiple JVM based Java processes running on the same machine.

## Features
*   Acquire lock with optional timeout (blocking)
*   Try to acquire lock (non-blocking)
*   Explicitely release lock
*   Automatically release lock when process finishes, crashes or is killed
*   Comprehensive test suite

## Installation
The library itself does not have any further dependencies apart from JRE 7 or higher, so it can be installed by just
adding `IpLock`-class to your project.

## Usage
This is an example for making a process exclusive on a machine:
```
public class ProcessSingleton {

    private static final IpLock LOCK = new IpLock("/tmp/ProcessSingleton.lock");

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        if (!LOCK.tryLock()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException(
                "Another instance of this process is already running");
        }

        try {
            // do your stuff instead
            Thread.sleep(5000);
        } finally {
            LOCK.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```
